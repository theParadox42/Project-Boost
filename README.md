# Project Boost
A 3D unity project I'm working on as of 6/15/19. Currently 10 levels with increasing difficulty
## TODO
- Add a menu
- Save levels finished
- Update icon quality
- Make more levels. 10/? so far, maybe I'll make anywhere from 20 to 50, guessing around 25
## Builds
There is a builds folder for this project, but some of the builds come out so large, I *.gitignore***d** it. Feel free to download my project and produce the builds yourself, but you have no rights to produce money off of this, and are prohibited from selling or publicly distributing any version of this without my direct consent.
